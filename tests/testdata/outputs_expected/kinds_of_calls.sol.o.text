The return value of a message call is not checked.
External calls return a boolean value. If the callee contract halts with an exception, 'false' is returned and execution continues in the caller. It is usually recommended to wrap external calls into a require statement to prevent unexpected states.

Use of callcode is deprecated.
The callcode method executes code of another contract in the context of the caller account. Due to a bug in the implementation it does not persist sender and value over the call. It was therefore deprecated and may be removed in the future. Use the delegatecall method instead.

The contract delegates execution to another contract with a user-supplied address.
The smart contract delegates execution to a user-supplied address. Note that callers can execute arbitrary contracts and that the callee contract can access the storage of the calling contract.

A call to a user-supplied address is executed.
The callee address of an external message call can be set by the caller. Note that the callee can contain arbitrary code and may re-enter any function in this contract. Review the business logic carefully to prevent averse effects on the contract state.
